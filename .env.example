# "live"  = (future) live trading
PROFILE=paper

# === Broker selection ===

BROKER=alpaca

# === Alpaca API configuration ===
# Alpaca paper trading URL:
ALPACA_BASE_URL=https://paper-api.alpaca.markets

# === Behavior flags ===
# MOCK_MODE=false means:
#   - Use AlpacaBrokerAdapter
#   - Stream source must be real (alpaca/sip/etc.)
#   - Orders should actually be sent to Alpaca paper (not simulated)
# MOCK_MODE=true means:
#   - Force MockBrokerAdapter and mock data
#   - No live orders will be sent
MOCK_MODE=false

# DRY_RUN=false means "actually place orders through the adapter"
# DRY_RUN=true means "pretend to place orders but DO NOT send to broker"
DRY_RUN=false

# If you set MOCK_MODE=false but you leave ALPACA_KEY_ID blank or wrong, the backend will start in a degraded state.
# /health will return ok=false and the Control Center will show a yellow warning.

# === Misc / kill switch support ===
# Optional fast-fail kill switch topic, heartbeat intervals, etc.
# (keep any existing custom vars you already rely on)
