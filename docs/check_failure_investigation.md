# CI Failure Investigation and Plan

## Summary of Findings
- Running `make verify-phase1` fails immediately because the repository pins Python to version 3.11.9 via `.python-version`, but that interpreter is not available in the toolchain (`pyenv: version \\`3.11.9\\` is not installed`).
- The GitHub Actions workflow uses `actions/setup-python@v5` with `python-version: '3.11'`, which installs the latest available 3.11.x release (currently 3.11.12). The stricter local pin prevents `pyenv` from using the installed interpreter, so every phase exits before linting/tests can run.

## Plan of Attack
1. **Normalize the Python version pin**: Update `.python-version` to the more flexible `3.11` so that both local environments and GitHub Actions resolve to the installed 3.11.x patch release. This mirrors how `actions/setup-python` behaves and prevents hard failures when a specific patch release becomes unavailable. ✅ _Completed in this iteration._
2. **Re-run CI entry points locally**: After adjusting the pin, run `make verify-phase1` through `make verify-phase8` (or the targeted phases) to surface any downstream linting, unit test, or verifier issues that were previously hidden by the interpreter failure.
3. **Address follow-up failures if any**: If subsequent runs uncover lint or test regressions, fix them iteratively, keeping documentation up to date.
4. **Document environment expectations**: Update contributor documentation (e.g., `README.md` or `docs/` guides) to clarify the supported Python version range so future contributors do not re-introduce an overly specific `.python-version` pin. ✅ _Completed in this iteration._

## Resolution

- `.python-version` now specifies `3.11`, matching the floating minor version used in CI setup workflows.
- The Quick start section in `README.md` highlights the Python 3.11.x requirement so that contributors align their local interpreters before installing dependencies.

## Next Steps
- Implement step 1 and open a PR.
- Monitor the CI run to confirm that the jobs progress past the interpreter bootstrap stage and report any additional issues for remediation.
